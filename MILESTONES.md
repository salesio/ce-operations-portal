# Data Layer Migration — Milestones

Frontend progressive migration under `VITE_DATA_SOURCE=mock|local|api|supabase`.  
Browser does **not** connect to PostgreSQL directly. Supabase/API = future phase.

## Storage model

- Isolated keys: `ce-data-layer:*`
- Dual-write bridges keep UI state + data layer in sync
- localStorage is **pilot/dev only**
- PostgreSQL / Supabase schema prepared under `database/` (not live for UI modules yet)
